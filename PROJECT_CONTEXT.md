# Timeline Tool Project Context
For Future Chat Handoffs EX "Continue helping me build this timeline tool: https://github.com/akrause2/timeline-tool - We just completed Phase 1 (data architecture), moving to Phase 2 (spreadsheet interface)"
## Project Scope
3D/2D Timeline visualization tool with AI integration, tab-based UI (table ↔ timeline), D3 charts above timelines in 3D space.

## Current Phase
Phase 1 complete: Data architecture, state management, basic tab system with sample data.

## Next Phase
Phase 2: Full spreadsheet-like table interface with advanced CRUD operations.

## Key Files
- src/data/schema.js - Data models and validation
- src/state/stateManager.js - Centralized state with events/undo-redo
- src/main.js - App entry point with tab system
- public/index.html - Basic HTML structure

## Architecture Decisions
- Tab switching (not side panels) for performance
- Shared state between 2D/3D renderers
- AI populates same table format as manual entry

//I'm continuing work on a timeline tool. Here's the project structure: [paste your file tree]. The main files are: [attach or paste the 4 key files]. We just completed Phase 1 of a 10-phase plan focusing on [brief description]. What's the best way to continue?"

## All phases, Implementation Plan for 3D/2D Timeline Tool with AI Integration
Phase 1: Foundation & Data Architecture (Week 1-2)
Core Data Schema Design
Create unified table format supporting: timeline_id, event_id, timestamp, title, description, category, chart_data_refs, metadata, ai_generated_flag, confidence_score
Build data validation and sanitization functions
Implement basic CRUD operations for table data
Create data export/import utilities (JSON, CSV)
Design the shared state management system that both renderers will use
Why First: Everything depends on this. Changes to data structure later require refactoring everything downstream.
Phase 2: Tab Navigation System & Data Table Interface (Week 2-3)
Full-Screen Tab Architecture
Build clean tab switching system (Table ↔ Timeline views)
Implement state preservation between tab switches (timeline position, selections, zoom levels)
Create performance-optimized tab switching (pause unused renderers)
Spreadsheet-Style Data Management
Build full-screen table interface with complete row/column visibility
Implement inline editing, row/column operations, copy/paste workflows
Add data validation with real-time feedback
Create import wizards for CSV/Excel files
Basic undo/redo functionality
Why Combined: Tab system needs to exist before building individual views, and table is simpler to implement first for testing the architecture.
Phase 3: Basic 2D Timeline Renderer (Week 3-4)
Canvas/SVG Timeline Foundation
Build core 2D timeline with multiple parallel tracks on Y-axis
Implement basic event rendering (rectangles, circles, labels)
Create pan/zoom functionality and time navigation
Add basic interaction (hover, click, selection)
Simple responsive design for different screen sizes
Tab integration: Preserve timeline state when switching to table mode
Why 2D First: Faster development cycle for testing data pipeline and tab switching, easier debugging of state management.
Phase 4: AI API Integration (Week 4-5)
Natural Language to Timeline Data
Integrate AI API for text-to-timeline conversion
Build prompt engineering system for consistent data extraction
Implement confidence scoring and source attribution
Create conversational refinement interface within table tab
Add document upload and processing capabilities
Seamless workflow: AI populates table, user switches to timeline tab to see results
Why Here: You have solid data foundations and tab switching, can test AI output immediately through existing 2D renderer.
Phase 5: Three.js 3D Timeline Renderer (Week 5-7)
3D Spatial Timeline Visualization
Create 3D scene with multiple timeline tracks on XZ plane
Implement camera controls (orbit, pan, zoom)
Build 3D event objects with proper positioning
Add interaction system (raycasting, selection, hover states)
Create smooth transitions and animations
Performance optimization: Proper cleanup when switching to table tab
Why After 2D: You understand data patterns and interaction needs. Tab system handles performance concerns automatically.
Phase 6: 2D ↔ 3D Mode Switching Within Timeline Tab (Week 7-8)
Dual Timeline Renderers
Add 2D/3D toggle within the timeline tab
Build shared state synchronization between timeline renderers
Implement smooth transitions between 2D and 3D views
Ensure interaction parity between modes
Maintain tab performance: Only one timeline renderer active at once
Why Separate Phase: This is complex synchronization work that benefits from having both renderers stable first.
Phase 7: D3 Chart Integration System (Week 8-10)
Charts Above Timelines
Design chart-to-timeline association system in data table
Implement D3 chart rendering to canvas textures (3D mode)
Create SVG chart overlays (2D mode)
Build coordinate transformation utilities
Add chart interaction and synchronized highlighting
Tab workflow: Configure charts in table, visualize in timeline
Why This Late: Charts need stable timeline positioning. Complex integration benefits from solid tab architecture.
Phase 8: Advanced AI Features (Week 10-11)
Intelligent Data Enhancement
Implement auto-categorization and tagging in table view
Add cross-timeline relationship detection
Build suggested visualization recommendations
Create smart data clustering and grouping
Add conversational data refinement
Workflow integration: AI suggestions appear in table, results visible in timeline tab
Phase 9: Polish & Performance Optimization (Week 11-12)
Tab System Optimization
Performance profiling and optimization for tab switching
Memory management for suspended renderers
Advanced table features (multi-select, bulk operations, advanced filtering)
Timeline interaction improvements
Comprehensive testing of tab workflows
Phase 10: Advanced Features (Week 12+)
Power User Capabilities
Real-time collaboration features
Advanced export options (images, videos, presentations)
Plugin system for custom chart types
API for third-party integrations
Advanced AI capabilities (predictive analysis, anomaly detection)
Key Architecture Changes
Performance-first tab switching - only active tab consumes resources
State preservation system - seamless context switching between table and timeline
Optimized rendering pipeline - clean pause/resume for unused views
Simplified UI architecture - no complex layout management, just clean full-screen modes
This updated plan prioritizes the clean tab experience you want while maintaining the logical build progression. Each phase delivers working functionality with the performance benefits of single-view rendering.
